Currently only these commands are partially implemented:

 - `ipfs init`
 - `ipfs add` (no recursive add, but it does take any number of file arguments)
 - `ipfs file ls`
 - `ipfs object get`

My understanding is that this is all the legacy protobuf-based serialization, and it will have to be redone when IPLD is finished.
